# Raytracing

A barebones raytracing rendered written in C++ for a computer graphics course during my bachelor's degree.

I keep this repository public to as a part of my code portfolio, but it is in no way maintained anymore.
The stb_image and stb_image_write single header libraries are open doimain and found at https://github.com/nothings/stb.
